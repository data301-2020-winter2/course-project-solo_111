## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this analytics project, I hope to find out what makes a chocolate bar good when taking into account the several factors that go into its production, such as place of origin, cocoa percentage, and bean type. I am interested in this topic because it is easy to understand due to how well known chocolate is around the world. Additionally, the topic is somewhat fun for the average data scientist to come across. The dataset itself appeals to me because it contains useful and easy-to-interpret information. The information collected is objective (with the exception of the reviews) and very simple to follow which is especially useful when there are over 5000 entries to analyze. What subjective information I do have comes from a respected critic which should help with how taste sometimes differs between individuals. Some questions I hope to answer in this project are "Does cocao bean type and cocoa percentage influence a bar's rating?" and "Does a chocolate bar's company and bean origin affect a bar's rating?" I believe building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset is quite doable given how accessible the topic is.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

I obtained my project's dataset from Kaggle, a community driven data science company. My chosen dataset contains a multitude of expert ratings that span over 1700 types of chocolate bars, as well as additional information about the chocolate including region made and percentage of cocoa among other things. This dataset is based on reviews collected in from 2006-2017. The purpose of this dataset is for fun and is inspired by questions like "What company makes the best chocolate?" The subjective ratings within this dataset were made by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. The objective data in this dataset was compiled by Dr. Rachael Tatman.

The following list was obtained from kaggle and gives insight towards Brelinski's ratings:
5 = Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
4 = Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
3 = Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
2 = Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
1 = Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)
